## 👋 Hey, I’m **Nikita**

I’m a backend developer at [KMS Lighthouse](https://www.kmslh.com/) building the search and everything around it. In my spare time, I participate in various hackathons like 🇰🇷 **JunctionX Seoul** with my team 🏆 **[@daredevils](https://github.com/daredevils-team)**, learn new technologies and code some open-source projects.

All the things I'm currently working on are available on my **[current tasks](https://github.com/users/xtenzQ/projects/3)** board. Feel free to contribute to my [repositories](https://github.com/xtenzQ?tab=repositories) no matter how small the change is - even typo fixes are welcome!

I'm also open to job opportunities, feel free to check my **[CV](https://xtenzq.github.io/cv)**.

<sub>_Why is the repo starred? Once there was a fancy profile README.md mentioned **[here](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme)**. If you wanna check it, go to the **[`backup`](https://github.com/xtenzQ/xtenzQ/tree/backup)** branch of my profile repo._</sub>
