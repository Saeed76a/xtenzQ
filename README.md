## 👋 Hey, I’m **Nikita**

I am a backend developer at [KMS Lighthouse](https://www.kmslh.com/), where I build the search functionality and everything related to it. In my spare time, I participate in various hackathons, such as 🇰🇷 **JunctionX Seoul** with my team, the 🏆 **[@daredevils](https://github.com/daredevils-team)**. I also enjoy learning new technologies and working on open-source projects.

You can find all the projects I am currently working on listed on my **[task board](https://github.com/users/xtenzQ/projects/3)**. Please feel free to contribute to my [repositories](https://github.com/xtenzQ?tab=repositories), no matter how small the change. Even fixing typos is appreciated!
