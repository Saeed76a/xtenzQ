### 👋

Hey, I’m **Nikita**.

I’m a ⌨️ backend developer and 🤖 machine learning researcher currently working at ♥ **[@kmslighthouse](https://www.kmslh.com/)** building 🔎 search module. In my spare time, I participate in various hackathons like 🇰🇷 **[@junctionxseoul](https://www.facebook.com/junctionxseoul)** with my team 🏆 **[@daredevils](https://github.com/daredevils-team)** and code open-source.
