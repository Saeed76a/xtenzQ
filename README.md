### 👋

Hey, I’m **Nikita**.

I’m a backend developer and machine learning researcher currently working at ♥ 🇮🇱 **[KMS Lighthouse](https://www.kmslh.com/)** working on a search engine. In my spare time, I participate in various hackathons like 🇰🇷 **JunctionX Seoul** with my team 🏆 **[@daredevils](https://github.com/daredevils-team)** and code open-source. I participated in an exchange program at **Inha University** in 2019.
