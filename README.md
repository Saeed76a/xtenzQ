### Hey, I’m Nikita 👋

I’m a backend developer and machine learning researcher currently working at ♥ **[@kmslighthouse](https://www.kmslh.com/)** building search module. In my spare time, I participate in various hackathons (like JunctionX Seoul) with my team 🏆 **[@daredevils](https://github.com/daredevils-team)** and code open-source projects.

_Why is the repo starred? Once there was a fancy profile README.md mentioned **[here](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme)**. If you wanna check it, go to the **[`backup`](https://github.com/xtenzQ/xtenzQ/tree/backup)** branch of my profile repo._
